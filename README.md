# üèÜ Swahili Embeddings Text Leaderboard

A joint community effort to create a Swahili central leaderboard for Embeddings. These models are currently evaluated using various Swahili text embeddings. Contributions and corrections are welcome! <br>
We refer to a model being "open" if it can be locally deployed and used commercially.

## How to Contribute

We are always happy to contribute! You can contribute by the following:

- table work (don't forget the links):
    - filling in missing entries
    - adding a new model as a new row to the leaderboard. Please keep the descending order.
    - adding a new benchmark as a new column in the leaderboard and the benchmark to the benchmarks table. Please keep the descending order.
- code work:
    - improving the existing code
    - requesting and implementing new features


## Sponsorship

The benchmark is Swahili-based, and we still need support translating and curating more tasks into Swahili. We welcome sponsorships to help advance this endeavour. Your sponsorship would facilitate this essential translation effort, bridging language barriers and making the benchmark accessible to a broader audience. We're grateful for the dedication shown by our collaborators and aim to extend this impact further with the support of sponsors committed to advancing language technologies."
